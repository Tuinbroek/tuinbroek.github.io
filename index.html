                <p>
                    Hey there! My name is Richie Elia and I am a 24 year old UX Design student at the The Hague University of Applied Sciences set to graduate in 2022. 
                    Prior to my studies I have worked as a Head Chef for "Brouwerij de Prael", a multi-franchise brewery with locations throughout the Netherlands.
                    Besides working there I have worked at many other hospitality businesses and I have filled pretty much any role available in hospitaly.
                    This is one of the reasons I decided to start the User Experience Design course at THUAS, after which I hope to tackle a new adventure in the field of UX Design. 
                    In my free time I enjoy making and listening to music. In addition to that, I also enjoy cooking, playing video games and socializing with friends.
                </p>

                            I am proficient in all programmes in the Adobe Creative Cloud. 
                            Besides that I am also proficient at using Javascript, HTML and CSS. If you need your front-end done, I am your guy! ;)

                            I have been a part of and led several research projects, which were focussed around UX Design. 
                            Therefore, I believe that I am skilled in getting to know your users and what goals and/or frustrations they may have in live. 
                            This allows you to help them tackle those goals and/or frustrations.

                            Besides digital design I am also skilled in making physical prototypes and/or visualisations.
